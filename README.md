# windows-curser-changer
This is a small script which allows you to easily change the cursor appearance. It will prompt you to provide a path to a folder where you can place .cur as well as .ani files. The script should automatically detect which file corresponds to which cursor as long as the filename includes certain keywords like 'arrow', 'working', or 'busy'. It automatically creates a scheme for you and opens the mouse settings. When you press 'OK', the scheme is applied. With this script, you can **create**, **list**, and **delete** themes.
